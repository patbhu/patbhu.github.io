                <h4 id="bio-introduction">Introduction</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I joined the UCSD Environmental, Health, and Safety department as the Stormwater
                    Management Intern as part of my major’s senior internship project (Environmental Systems).
                    My role focused on researching and analyzing solutions that would curb littering behavior
                    on campus.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I conducted 2 experiments: Poster and Bucket experiments. To begin, I picked 2 sites
                    for the poster and 3 sites for the bucket. Before starting anything, I assessed the
                    trash level at all three sites and picked up all cigarette butts in the area to create
                    a baseline for the experiment. In total, I picked up cigarette butts at the following
                    sites: 1,500 at Pacific Hall, 60 at the Village, 200 at Rock Bottom Bridge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Experiment 1: Poster</h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the beginning of the project, I designed posters as a potential solution to
                    change smokers’ behavior. Using an online graphic design website, Canva, I created
                    two posters with anti-littering messages as an attempt to have them reconsider
                    throwing cigarette butts to the ground.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    These posters were posted on walls or lamp posts in two areas: the Village and Pacific
                    Hall. I conducted weekly trash assessments for a couple weeks to measure the difference
                    in the number of cigarette butss picked up. However, after comparing the data, I noticed
                    that there was not a significant trend to establish how effectives the posters were. As a
                    result, I moved on to the bucket experiment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Experiment 2: Bucket</h6>
                <br>
                <p>

                    The second method I used was a “Butt Bucket”. I created the bucket to serve as a cigarette
                    receptacle that would encourage smokers to utilize the bucket to dispose of their cigarettes instead
                    of leaving it on the ground. The bucket included posters from the previous experiment to bolster the
                    message of
                    anti-littering. Additionally, I expanded the bucket experiment to the Rock Bottom Bridge to include
                    another hotspot for cigarette smokers. From there, I conducted weekly trash assessment and
                    determined that there were significant trends at all three sites.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 id="bio-results">Results</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    At Pacific Hall, the bucket helped reduce the total number of cigarette butts on the ground.
                    However, based on the graph, there was a gradual increase in cigarette butts on the ground. As a
                    result, this experiment was not effective in curbing littering behavior.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    At the Village, there were mixed results based on the weekly amount of cigarette butts picked and
                    the graph demonstrates a neutral trend. As a result, this experiment could not confirm if the bucket
                    was effective or not effective.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    At Rock Bottom bridge, the graph demonstrates a positive trend with less cigarette butts picked up
                    each week. Overall, this site had the most significant impact in the amount of cigarettes collected
                    in the bucket and saw a 40% decrease from the first to the last cleanup. As a result, experiment
                    confirmed the bucket at this site was effective in curbing littering behavior.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4 id="bio-conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This experiment provided data to support having a bucket at the Rock Bottom bridge would be the most
                    effective way to curb littering behavior. Potential recommendations for the future would be to
                    expand the Butt Buckets to significant hotspots on campus and designate those areas for people to
                    smoke. Another alternative would be to reform how the UCSD Police Department gives out citations to
                    smokers by incorporating an educational component on the dangers of smoking and cigarette littering
                    along with a fine.

                <br>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For our final project in ​Introduction to GIS and GPS for Scientists​, our group analyzed the
                    impact that anthropogenic activities have on “The Knoll”, a Natural Coastal Reserve designated to
                    protect fragile ecosystems. Due to frequent visitors that explore and hike there, the Knoll is
                    subjected to urban runoff and other waste. Using ESRI ArcGIS to manipulate the LIDAR, SANDAG, and
                    GPS data collected, our team analyzed the soil and elevation data to propose natural remediation
                    biofilters to be installed at locations at the Knoll and marine coastline to minimize human impact
                    and other negative externalities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Data & Analysis</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To begin, our group created an elevation profile with color maps and contours to depict the vertical
                    changes on the Knoll (Figure 1). Using the elevation data and mathematical calculation, we created a
                    contour map of of Flow Direction to illustrate the general direction of flow (Figure 2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the two figures, we mapped out the stream channel network of the Knoll System, with the yellow
                    to red gradient depicting the area of concentrated flow (Figure 4). We picked location 1 and 2 on
                    Figure 3 as potential areas to install the biofilter system. When we factored in the fact that there
                    is a parking lot at location 1, we determined that it would be optimal to install the filter there
                    due to the potential pollutants the water runoff would accumulate at that location.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Using the soil data from SANDAG, we labeled the two different soil types at the Knoll​ ​in Figure 5:
                    Chestern fine sandy loam and terrace escarpments. Some of the characteristics that are attributed to
                    the sandy loam are slow permeability, slow to medium runoff, and gentle to moderate steep surfaces.
                    Nearby, the Terrace escarpments are on steeps lows with sparse vegetation, except with areas of
                    grass and shrubs; this demonstrates that runoff occurs down the cliffs and towards the ocean.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The two main plants that make up the Knoll are ​Artemisia Californica​ ​and ​Encelia Californica​.
                    In Figure 6, you can see the different plants in the Knoll, with large numbers of Artemisia in the
                    northwest and southeast of the Knoll while Encelia covering most of the southwest and center of the
                    Knoll. Artemisia generally uses less water than than Encelia; this correlates to the plant
                    distribution in the Knoll where the areas that water flows through has more Encelia and vice versa.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                <h2>Shipment Training Reorganization</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When I first started working at Everspring Corporation as the Supply Chain Coordinator, the previous
                    worker Crystal trained me on the Logistical/Supply Chain process. Although there was no manual guide
                    and examples for me to follow, I took detailed notes and executed my responsibilities. When my
                    manager notified that they were planning on hiring someone new to help out the office, I suggested
                    that I can assist with creating a more helpful and detailed guide for the new employee.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Training Notes and Presentation</h4>
                <br>
                <div class="col-xs-12" style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="src/assets/training-reorganization/img-1.jpg" height="400px">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On Powerpoint, I transferred the notes used in the other documents and condensed it to list major
                    points of the direct shipment process. This would create a more visual approach to understanding the
                    process. I used arrow boxes to indicate the main objectives and then added arrows and boxes below to
                    indicate the more detailed steps to take. I used the thinner arrows to indicate the direction of the
                    steps to the next column to make it easier for new employees to follow.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Employee Evaluation</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After seeing my training notes, my manager tasked me with recreating the rubric to evaluate
                    individual performance. She wanted to conduct a peer to peer evaluation and give feedback on each
                    employee’s progress and look for areas of improvement. The rubric previously used had many
                    categories that was not relevant in addressing individual’s responsibilities. I combined similar
                    categories and rewrote the description in each score per category.
                </p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h4>Lasting Effects</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My coworker told me that the notes and presentation that I created was helpful for her when she
                    first started working here. Now, as she transitions out of her position, she refers to my notes and
                    presentation when guiding the new employee that will replace her. Additionally, my manager expressed
                    her appreciation with the employee evaluation rubric that I updated because it allowed provide
                    constructive feedback to each person.

                <h2>EU Should Recycle</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a Residential Advisor for UCSD, I was in charge of providing resources and hosting events for a
                    building of 120 first year residents. Each quarter, each building only received $125, which equated
                    to $1 per person. I wanted to find ways to get more funding in order to put on more quality events
                    that residents would attend. Additionally, most of the recycling bins and waste at UCSD was not
                    processed and recycled properly so I wanted my building to play a part in addressing that issue.
                    Many residents might have desires to help the environment but don’t know how to go about it; One
                    idea was to create a recycling program that every resident could partake in.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The program creates a platform for them to feel empowered and take the next steps towards improving
                    the environment. We would use the recyclables collected to exchange it for money at a recycling
                    center addressing the funding and waste issue simultaneously. To incentivize residents to
                    participate, I made the recycling program a competition between each suite of residents; at the end
                    of the competition, the suite that collected the most recyclable would receive a portion of the
                    funds collected and would use it for something that would benefit their whole suite.

                        <p>
                            In the beginning of the program, each suite was given a recycling basket with plastic bags
                            to shore their recyclables collected each week. I also notified the custodial staff to not
                            collect the recyclables since it was part of a building program and they supported us by 
                            providing larger bags to collect the bottles and cans.

                            In order to get residents to participate in the program and other programs I hosted, I
                            created a
                            point system for each suite to earn points. There were two ways to earn points: attend
                            weekly
                            newsletters and/or collect cans and bottles to be recycled. For each resident that attended
                            newsletters, they would get 1 point; for each bottle/can they collect, they would be .1
                            points.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of the program, the winning suite was 400; they collected a total of 1,259bottles/cans.
                    Collectively as a building, we recycled over 4,200 bottles/cans. Towards the end of the program, our
                    residents recycled less per week. While that can easily be attributed to a lack of participation or
                    interest, it was actually due to their desire to be more sustainable. When residents saw how much
                    plastics and aluminum cans they accumulated per week, they began to shift to more sustainable
                    options such as using reusable aluminum bottles sold at the bookstore.

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I was a Residential Advisor for a group of 120 first year residents. One of my main responsibilities
                    was creating events for residents to partake in. However, towards the end of the year, some
                    residents wanted to and were eager to be more involved with the residential community. As a result,
                    I formed a new programming committee called the Europe Hall Programming Committee (EUPC) for
                    residents who wanted to contribute more. Since we had 13 members, we split our committee split in
                    two and featured one small and one large project for the building.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Events/Projects</h4>
                <br>
                <h6>Merch and Mac</h6>
                <br>
                <div class="col-xs-12" style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="src/assets/eu-programming/merch-n-mac.gif" height="250px">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One thing that some residents wanted to see was merchandise for Europe Hall, something tangible that
                    they can remember by and show off to other residents. The first group was responsible for designing
                    and ordering stickers and pins. On the stickers, they created something that embodies Europe Hall;
                    On the pins, they designed it to indicate which RA they support (jokingly).
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="col-xs-12" style="text-align: center;">

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once the merchandise was ordered, the residents created a facebook event to invite and welcome their
                    peers to attend; they included food in the form of macaroni and cheese to get more participants.
                    Over 40 residents attended and picked up merchandise. The next couple of days, other residents were
                    talking about Europe Hall merchandise that we passed out to our residents. After the merchandise
                    gained more visibility, our residents that did not receive it started asking us for them!

                <h6>Europe Hall Yearbook/Oh My Dawgs</h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our other group in the committee was in charge of creating a yearbook for all the residents
                    at the end of the year, similar to what seniors do at the end of high school. Additionally, they
                    wanted to expand the event to have something to include the whole community by incorporating dogs
                    for residents to come and play with.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 mb-4" style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="src/assets/eu-programming/yearbook-1.jpg" height="400px">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 mb-4" style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="src/assets/eu-programming/yearbook-4.jpg" height="400px">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <p>
                    To publish the yearbook, the group went around to all the suites and took pictures of the residents
                    in each suite. They also asked residents to nominate superlatives such as “Best…” and “Most likely…”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once the yearbook was published, the group began to plan for the event with dogs, Oh My Dawgs. They
                    contacted students, professors and administrators that had dogs and invited them to bring their dogs
                    to the event.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="col-xs-12" style="text-align: center;">

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The event got the attention as word spread throughout the community that there would be dogs. Many
                    residents saw the group’s booth and multiple dogs running around the area and participated in the
                    event; the turnout of the event was over 80 participants.

                <h4>Lasting Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    While most of the events were at the end of the year, the residents of Europe Hall noticed the
                    groups efforts and praised their efforts. Many even wished for events like these to have been held
                    earlier during the year. It was encouraging to see that their peers were asking for more events to
                    be put on by EUPC, demonstrating the positive impact that this group has on Europe Hall and the
                    community.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As an RA, the goals are to get residents involved in the community and hosting events for them to
                    attend. EUPC fulfilled both goals; it made the job easier by having an established and comprehensive
                    programming models that encourage peer to peer interaction and community growth through well
                    executed events that caters to the community. With this experience, many members of EUPC have
                    branched to student leadership positions within the community or have taken more responsibilities
                    with their campus organization.
