                <br>
                <p>
                    I joined the UCSD Environmental, Health, and Safety department as the Stormwater
                    Management Intern as part of my major’s senior internship project (Environmental Systems).
                    My role focused on researching and analyzing solutions that would curb littering behavior
                    on campus.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I conducted 2 experiments: Poster and Bucket experiments. To begin, I picked 2 sites
                    for the poster and 3 sites for the bucket. Before starting anything, I assessed the
                    trash level at all three sites and picked up all cigarette butts in the area to create
                    a baseline for the experiment. In total, I picked up cigarette butts at the following
                    sites: 1,500 at Pacific Hall, 60 at the Village, 200 at Rock Bottom Bridge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Experiment 1: Poster</h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the beginning of the project, I designed posters as a potential solution to
                    change smokers’ behavior. Using an online graphic design website, Canva, I created
                    two posters with anti-littering messages as an attempt to have them reconsider
                    throwing cigarette butts to the ground.

                    These posters were posted on walls or lamp posts in two areas: the Village and Pacific
                    Hall. I conducted weekly trash assessments for a couple weeks to measure the difference
                    in the number of cigarette butss picked up. However, after comparing the data, I noticed
                    that there was not a significant trend to establish how effectives the posters were. As a
                    result, I moved on to the bucket experiment.

                <h6>Experiment 2: Bucket</h6>
                <br>
                <p>

                    The second method I used was a “Butt Bucket”. I created the bucket to serve as a cigarette
                    receptacle that would encourage smokers to utilize the bucket to dispose of their cigarettes instead
                    of leaving it on the ground. The bucket included posters from the previous experiment to bolster the
                    message of
                    anti-littering. Additionally, I expanded the bucket experiment to the Rock Bottom Bridge to include
                    another hotspot for cigarette smokers. From there, I conducted weekly trash assessment and
                    determined that there were significant trends at all three sites.

                <p>
                    At Pacific Hall, the bucket helped reduce the total number of cigarette butts on the ground.
                    However, based on the graph, there was a gradual increase in cigarette butts on the ground. As a
                    result, this experiment was not effective in curbing littering behavior.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    At the Village, there were mixed results based on the weekly amount of cigarette butts picked and
                    the graph demonstrates a neutral trend. As a result, this experiment could not confirm if the bucket
                    was effective or not effective.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    At Rock Bottom bridge, the graph demonstrates a positive trend with less cigarette butts picked up
                    each week. Overall, this site had the most significant impact in the amount of cigarettes collected
                    in the bucket and saw a 40% decrease from the first to the last cleanup. As a result, experiment
                    confirmed the bucket at this site was effective in curbing littering behavior.

                <p>
                    This experiment provided data to support having a bucket at the Rock Bottom bridge would be the most
                    effective way to curb littering behavior. Potential recommendations for the future would be to
                    expand the Butt Buckets to significant hotspots on campus and designate those areas for people to
                    smoke. Another alternative would be to reform how the UCSD Police Department gives out citations to
                    smokers by incorporating an educational component on the dangers of smoking and cigarette littering
                    along with a fine.

                <br>
                <p>
                    For our final project in ​Introduction to GIS and GPS for Scientists​, our group analyzed the
                    impact that anthropogenic activities have on “The Knoll”, a Natural Coastal Reserve designated to
                    protect fragile ecosystems. Due to frequent visitors that explore and hike there, the Knoll is
                    subjected to urban runoff and other waste. Using ESRI ArcGIS to manipulate the LIDAR, SANDAG, and
                    GPS data collected, our team analyzed the soil and elevation data to propose natural remediation
                    biofilters to be installed at locations at the Knoll and marine coastline to minimize human impact
                    and other negative externalities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Data & Analysis</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To begin, our group created an elevation profile with color maps and contours to depict the vertical
                    changes on the Knoll (Figure 1). Using the elevation data and mathematical calculation, we created a
                    contour map of of Flow Direction to illustrate the general direction of flow (Figure 2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the two figures, we mapped out the stream channel network of the Knoll System, with the yellow
                    to red gradient depicting the area of concentrated flow (Figure 4). We picked location 1 and 2 on
                    Figure 3 as potential areas to install the biofilter system. When we factored in the fact that there
                    is a parking lot at location 1, we determined that it would be optimal to install the filter there
                    due to the potential pollutants the water runoff would accumulate at that location.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Using the soil data from SANDAG, we labeled the two different soil types at the Knoll​ ​in Figure 5:
                    Chestern fine sandy loam and terrace escarpments. Some of the characteristics that are attributed to
                    the sandy loam are slow permeability, slow to medium runoff, and gentle to moderate steep surfaces.
                    Nearby, the Terrace escarpments are on steeps lows with sparse vegetation, except with areas of
                    grass and shrubs; this demonstrates that runoff occurs down the cliffs and towards the ocean.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The two main plants that make up the Knoll are ​Artemisia Californica​ ​and ​Encelia Californica​.
                    In Figure 6, you can see the different plants in the Knoll, with large numbers of Artemisia in the
                    northwest and southeast of the Knoll while Encelia covering most of the southwest and center of the
                    Knoll. Artemisia generally uses less water than than Encelia; this correlates to the plant
                    distribution in the Knoll where the areas that water flows through has more Encelia and vice versa.
                </p>
